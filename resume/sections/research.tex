My research focuses on unifying controls and perception. I design algorithms that combine model-based controls with model-free learning and use representation learning to capture task-relevant state for control. The goal is autonomy in unstructured settings—particularly off-road and field robotics—where dynamics, terrain, and sensing can be highly variable. I am also interested in whole-body control for humanoids and high-DoF mobile platforms.
